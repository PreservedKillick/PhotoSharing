Photo sharing app

*Let's make an app that lets users upload their photos to share with the world.

*Start off by letting people create accounts, following along with the authentication Railscast.

*Then, let them upload photos.

*Next, allow them to tag other users in photos. To keep this simple, just display a list of all the users in a drop-down menu when you add a tag to a photo.
